## Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and standardized data formats.
   - Parsed datetime objects for time-based analysis.

2. **Traffic Trends Analysis**
   - Analyzed monthly, weekly, and hourly user traffic.
   - Detected peak hours and low-engagement periods.

3. **Traffic Source Analysis**
   - Segmented visitors by source: Direct, Organic, Paid, Referral, Social.
   - Evaluated each source's contribution to engagement and bounce rates.

4. **User Behavior Metrics**
   - Average session durations, bounce rates, and return visit counts.
   - Identified top and bottom-performing pages.

5. **Visualizations**
   - Created clear and informative plots: line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, and more.

## Findings & Insights

- **User Activity Peaks**: Most website traffic occurred during weekday mornings, particularly around 10 AM, suggesting business-focused visitors.
- **Bounce Rate Trends**: High bounce rates were associated with users coming from paid ad campaigns, while organic and referral traffic showed better engagement.
- **Top Traffic Sources**: Organic search and direct traffic were the leading sources, contributing over 70% of total sessions.
- **Short Visit Duration**: A large portion of users spent less than 30 seconds on the site, indicating possible UX or content relevance issues on landing pages.
- **High-Engagement Pages**: Blog articles and resources/tutorial sections had the highest average session duration and lowest exit rates.
- **Underperforming Pages Identified**: Several landing pages had high exit rates and low conversion, making them ideal candidates for A/B testing or redesign.

## Detailed Topic Descriptions

### 1. Sessions and Users Over Time
**What I Did:** Analyzed user and session trends over time using time series plots.  
**What I Found:** Weekday mornings showed traffic peaks; weekends were consistently low.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Shifting content drops and ads to peak weekday hours for better visibility.

### 2. Total Users by Channel
**What I Did:** Grouped users by marketing channels (e.g., Organic, Referral, Paid, Social, Direct) to evaluate where most users are coming from.
**What I Found:** Organic and Direct dominated; Paid traffic was low.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Invest more in SEO and Direct campaigns while reassessing Paid channel ROI.

### 3. Average Engagement Time by Channel
**What I Did:** Calculated the average engagement duration for users per channel to determine which sources bring the most active/retained users.  
**What I Found:** Referral and Organic channels had better user retention.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Emphasizing high-retention channels in marketing strategy.

### 4. Engagement Rate Distribution by Channel
**What I Did:** Plotted the spread of engagement rates across channels to understand variability and consistency in user interaction. 
**What I Found:** Organic traffic was consistent; Social traffic was volatile.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Testing targeted content for Social users to increase consistency.

### 5. Engaged vs Non-Engaged Sessions
**What I Did:** Labeled sessions as “engaged” or “non-engaged” based on defined thresholds (e.g., time on site, event count) and analyzed their ratios.
**What I Found:** Most sessions were non-engaged; spikes in engagement during midweek.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Optimizing landing pages and creating midweek promotions.

### 6. Traffic by Hour and Channel
**What I Did:** Analyzed hourly website traffic split by channels to identify optimal times for targeting specific acquisition sources. 
**What I Found:** All sources peaked between 10 AM–1 PM.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Scheduling posts and ads during those hours.

### 7. Engagement Rate vs Sessions Over Time
**What I Did:** Compared engagement rate trends against session volume to check if traffic spikes correspond to deeper user interaction.
**What I Found:** Some low-traffic days had high engagement, and vice versa.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Balancing quantity and quality of traffic through targeting.

### 8. Hourly Engagement Rate Trends
**What I Did:** Visualized how engagement rate fluctuates hour by hour during the day to recommend ideal publishing or campaign times.  
**What I Found:** Best engagement occurred in the morning.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Time-based content strategies (e.g., morning email campaigns).

### 9. Bounce Rate by Channel
**What I Did:** Calculated bounce rate for each traffic channel to diagnose low-performing entry paths and optimize user retention strategies.  
**What I Found:** Paid and Social had higher bounce rates.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Revisiting ad copy and social campaign targeting.

### 10. Correlation Between Engagement & Event Activity
**What I Did:** Computed correlation between user engagement (e.g., session duration, time on page) and event activity (e.g., clicks, scrolls).  
**What I Found:** Strong positive correlation — more events meant higher engagement.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Event-rich UX (e.g., CTA buttons, interactions).

### 11. Weekday vs Weekend Engagement
**What I Did:** Compared user behavior and engagement metrics between weekdays and weekends to uncover differences in usage patterns.
**What I Found:** Weekday users stayed longer; weekend users engaged more consistently.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Lighter, engaging weekend content vs. deep weekday content.

### 12. Users vs Event Count
**What I Did:** Plotted number of users against event counts to assess how user activity scales and identify outliers or inactive segments. 
**What I Found:** High variation in user interaction.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Identifying low-event users for re-targeting.

### 13. Channel-wise Sessions Over Time
**What I Did:** Visualized how sessions evolved over time for each channel — useful for tracking seasonal trends and campaign effects.  
**What I Found:** Organic and Direct were trending upward.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Boosting high-performing channels further with SEO and branding.

### 14. Predicting Session Engagement (Binary Classification)
**What I Did:** Built a machine learning classification model to predict whether a session will be engaged or not based on features like channel, time, device, etc.  
**What I Found:** Model accurately predicted engagement using time, source, device.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Real-time personalization based on predictors.

### 15. Cluster Behavior Patterns Using KMeans
**What I Did:** Applied unsupervised learning (KMeans Clustering) to group user sessions into behavioral clusters based on engagement, duration, and traffic source.  
**What I Found:** Segments emerged: engaged explorers, bounce visitors, passive users.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Engagement tactics for each user cluster.

### 16. Channel Cost Effectiveness
**What I Did:** Calculated cost per engaged session per channel (if cost data available) to evaluate ROI on marketing spend.  
**What I Found:** Referral and Organic had the best ROI; Paid was costly with poor returns.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Reducing Paid budget and reallocating to Referral strategies.

### 17. Campaign Period Comparison (Pre vs Post)
**What I Did:** Analyzed engagement and traffic before and after a specific campaign period to measure its effectiveness and impact.
**What I Found:** Traffic increased post-campaign, but engagement dropped slightly.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Combining campaigns with engagement-focused UX improvements.

### 18. Top vs Bottom Channel Comparison
**What I Did:** Ranked channels based on engagement, bounce rate, and session value. Compared top 3 vs bottom 3 to derive actionable recommendations.
**What I Found:** Top channels had longer sessions, lower bounce, better engagement.  
**How Can I Addressed It:** Pausing or fixing low-performing channels and focusing on the top ones.
