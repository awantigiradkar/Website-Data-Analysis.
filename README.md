## ðŸ“ˆ Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and standardized data formats.
   - Parsed datetime objects for time-based analysis.

2. **Traffic Trends Analysis**
   - Analyzed monthly, weekly, and hourly user traffic.
   - Detected peak hours and low-engagement periods.

3. **Traffic Source Analysis**
   - Segmented visitors by source: Direct, Organic, Paid, Referral, Social.
   - Evaluated each source's contribution to engagement and bounce rates.

4. **User Behavior Metrics**
   - Average session durations, bounce rates, and return visit counts.
   - Identified top and bottom-performing pages.

5. **Visualizations**
   - Created clear and informative plots: line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, and more.

## Findings & Insights

- **User Activity Peaks**: Most website traffic occurred during weekday mornings, particularly around 10 AM, suggesting business-focused visitors.
- **Bounce Rate Trends**: High bounce rates were associated with users coming from paid ad campaigns, while organic and referral traffic showed better engagement.
- **Top Traffic Sources**: Organic search and direct traffic were the leading sources, contributing over 70% of total sessions.
- **Short Visit Duration**: A large portion of users spent less than 30 seconds on the site, indicating possible UX or content relevance issues on landing pages.
- **High-Engagement Pages**: Blog articles and resources/tutorial sections had the highest average session duration and lowest exit rates.
- **Underperforming Pages Identified**: Several landing pages had high exit rates and low conversion, making them ideal candidates for A/B testing or redesign.
